        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>In a shallow bowl, add flour and salt together (combine salt with flour first)

            Add other dry ingredients and combine well
            
            Add lukewarm water to the dry mixture in bits to form a batter. You can add 500g at first then check if it needs more water. (the batter should not be runny and it shouldn't be thick as well, find a balance in between the two)
            
            Cover the bowl with a cling film or a damp towel and place in a warm place to proof. (Till batter doubles in size usually between an hour or two. You can leave it longer if you want)
            
            Once the mixture has risen and doubled in size, you then move on to frying.
            
            on medium-high heat, add enough oil to a  frying pan and heat till hot. Drop a tiny bit of batter in hot oil to test and if the batter floats to the top of the heat then it is ready to use</p>
